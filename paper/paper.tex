\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The one-dimensional bin packing problem (BPP) is a combinatorial optimisation problem that has been widely researched and discussed due to its ability to model a variety of real-life sitations.
The BPP can be described as follows: given a set of $n$ items of varying sizes $w$, and a finite number of bins with equal capacity $c$, find the minimum number of bins required to contain all of the items. As shown by \cite{garey1979}, this problem is NP-hard, and therefore (under the assumption that $P \neq NP$) there is no known algorithm that is able to find an optimal solution in polynomial time for every instance of the BPP. Instead, heursitics can be used to find a near-optimal solution in a shorter amount of time. One example is the greedy heuristic known as first-fit, an online algorithm that places each item (in some arbitrary order) into the lowest-indexed bin. If there are no bins that can feasibly accommodate the item, the algorithm places the item into a new bin. A modified version of first-fit yields the well-known first-fit decreasing (FFD) algorithm (\citealp{eilon1971}), which initially sorts the items into non-decreasing order of size before allocating them into bins. As proven by \cite{dosa2007} (tight bound), the worst case for FFD is $\frac{11}{9}k + \frac{6}{9}$ bins, where $k$ is the optimal number of bins given by $\ceil{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{i}}{c}}$ (..if the solution has this many bins then it is optimal, (\citealp{korf2002})).

In 2004, Goulimis brought to light an open-combinatorial problem related to the bin-packing problem. Corrugated boxes are formed in two stages: firstly, they are produced flat, then a device consistsing of knives mounted on a bar creates ``scores'' along specific lines on the flat boxes. These scores allow the boxes to be folded in predetermined places. The first stage of this process involves finding a feasible pattern of the flat boxes that minimises the amount of waste, and has been researched extensively. It is classically solved by delayed column-generation (\citealp{gilmore1961, gilmore1963}). However, the second step of this process requires an additional constraint.

The scoring knives, by design, cannot be placed too close together (around 70mm in industry), and as such have a ``minimum knife distance''. The problem then becomes a bin-packing problem with an additional constraint: find a feasible arrangement of boxes such that the sum of two adjacent score widths from different boxes is greater than or equal to the minimum knife distance. We will call this constraint the minimum total score width constraint.

\textcolor{red}{INSERT FIGURE TWO BOXES ANNOTATED AND KNIVES ON BAR FOLD LINES SCORE WIDTH}

\textcolor{blue}{Figure showing two boxes with score widths and the scoring knives mounted on a bar. Since the sum of the two adjacent score widths from different boxes is greater than or equal to 70mm, the minimum total width constraint has been met - this is a feasible alignment of these two boxes}

There exists a polynomial time algorithm that is able to recognise whether a particular instance of the problem is feasible or infeasible (\citealp{becker2010}) (i.e. whether all boxes can be arranged in one line). However, the algorithm does not consider the lengths of each individual box, or the total length of the final arrangement of boxes. In industry, strips of materials are provided in fixed lengths, so, given a large number of boxes to pack, it may not be feasible to pack all of the boxes onto one strip. 

This leads us to our main problem, the score-constrained bin-packing problem: given a collection of boxes with varying widths and score widths on either side, and strips of a fixed length, find the minimum number of strips required to accommodate all of the boxes, such that the minimum total width constraint is met between all boxes on all strips. 

The remainder of this report will firstly, in Section \ref{sec:ffdapprox}, introduce the first-fit decreasing approximate algorithm and describe the modifications made to consider the minimum score width constraint. In Section \ref{sec:ffdexact}, we will present a new algorithm which consists of the modified first-fit decreasing algorithm detailed in the previous section combined with a polynomial-time algorithm which will be used to find feasible sub-solutions. A comparison of the two algorithms and an analysis of the results will be provided in Section \ref{sec:compresult}, and finally Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper and proposes some potential directions for furture work.

\section{Formulating the problem}
We are given $n$ boxes that need to be packed onto strips. Each of these boxes have a positive width, and two score widths, one on either side of the box. Since these score widths are not necessarily equal, the boxes can be aligned in two ways: either in a ``regular'' alignment, where the smaller of the two score widths is on the left hand side of the box, or in a ``rotated'' alignment, where the box has been rotated by $180^{\circ}$ so that the larger score width is on the left-hand side of the box. Strips are packed left to right. We also have a finite number of strips of equal fixed lengths. Once a box has been placed onto a strip, the rightmost score on the strip is referred to as the ``free'' score. A box can only be placed onto a strip if it can fit onto the strip, i.e. the addition of the box to the strip doesn't exceed the length of the strip, and if the free score and one of the scores on the box meet the minimum total score width constraint, i.e. the sum of the free score width and one of the scores on the box is greater than or equal to the minimum total score width. Assume that no box has a width that is greater than the fixed length of the strips.

Definition: Score-Constrained Bin-Packing Problem. Find the minimum number of strips required to feasibly pack all the boxes such that the minimum total score width constraint is met between every pair of adjacent score widths from different boxes on every strip. Then the SCBPP consists of finding a feasible alignment of all of the boxes onto the strips such that every pair of adjacent score widths from different boxes meets the minimum total score width constraint, and that the least number of strips is used.


\section{FFD Using Approximate Algorithm}
\label{sec:ffdapprox}
\begin{itemize}
	\item discuss heuristics
	\item ``Heuristics are approximate solution techniques that typically provide solutions in the least amount of time to the detriment of the solutions quality''
	\item ``Exact methods find a best possible packing, but are slow and may be unable to provide solutions to large or reastically sized problem instances within reasonable time''
	\item ``Consider a set of $n$ items. In the context of bin packing problems, heuristics consider these items one-by-one and attempt to pack them into a bin so as to achieve a near-optimal solution without the guarantee that a solution is optimal.''
	\item ``Exact packing methods are often called deterministic methods and are guarantees to find an optimal solution to a problem (given sufficient time and a feasible region) while heuristics attempt to find optimal solutions, but are not guaranteed to do so.''
	\item ``Exact methods may often be too slow to solve large problem instances, but may typically be used to solve smaller ones.''
	\item ``Packing heuristics follow a fixed set of rules to pack items in such a manner as to find good, feasible (but not necessarily optimal) solutions to the bin packing problem within as short a time span as possible.''
	\item offline algorithm, whole problem data is provided/required at the start.
	\item online, doesn't consider future events/items, data is processed in the order that it is input into the algorithm, entire input is not required to be available from the start
	\item ``first-fit decreasing (FFD) algorithm for one-dimensional bin packing by johnson et al (1974, worst-case performance bounds for simple one-dimensional packing algorithms)''
	\item FF is online, FFD is offline
	\item FF and FFD can produce a feasible solution quickly, but the solution may not be optimal, O(nln n), where n is the number of items that need to be packed
	\item who stated that ffd is O(nlog n)?
	\item Coffman et al 1984 heuristics survey
	\item \textcolor{blue}{Describe how the ffdapprox algorithm works}
	\item \textcolor{red}{figure of packed boxes on strips}
	\item previously placed boxes are fixed, cannot be rearranged
	\item complexity of modified FFD for SCBPP
	\item background information on FFD
	\item works in the same way as FFD, but with an additional step - each box must meet the minimum total score width constraint, so if a box fits onto a strip, we start by checking if the smallest of the two score widths on the box, and the free score width on the end of the current strip, meet the mtswc. If not, then we rotate the box $180^{\circ}$ and check again if the mtswc is met. If neither score width on the box meets the mtswc with the free score width, then we move onto the next strip and try again.
	\item pack from left to right
	\item boxes can be aligned in two ways, with smaller score on LHS, or rotated $180^{\circ}$ so the smaller score is on the LHS
	\item Karp complexity
	\item \textcolor{red}{figure of one packed strip indicating free score end $e$}
	\item pros and cons: speed, however there may be a solution that exists that cannot be found due to boxes being fixed in place
	\item In this algorithm, the boxes are sorted by non-increasing widths prior to packing.
	\item If a box does not fit onto any existing strips, a new strip is initialised.
	\item Initially, pack the largest (widest/box with the largest width/first box in the sorted list of boxes) box into the first strip.
	\item ``Simchi-Levi (1994, ``New worst-case results for the bpp'') has shown that the FFD and the BFD heuristics have an absolute performance ratio of 1.5, and that this value is the best possible for the BPP, unles $P = NP$.''

DESCRIPTION OF FFDAPPROX 
\begin{itemize}
	\item start by sorting all boxes into non-increasing order of widths, breaking ties arbitrarily
	\item starting with the first box in the list (i.e with the box that has the largest width), put it onto the first strip, with the box rotated such that the side of the box with the smaller score width is placed at the beginning of the strip
	\item for each box, find the lowest indexed strip that the box can fit into
	\item if the box can fit onto a strip, check if the free score width on that strip and the smaller of the two score widths on the box meet the minimum total score width requirement. If so, place the box onto that strip such that the smaller of the two score widths is placed next to the free score width. Move onto the next box in the list
	\item else, check if the larger of the two score widths on the box and the free score width meet the minimum total score width constraint. If so, place the box onto that strip such that the larger of the two score widths is placed next to the free score width. Move onto the next box.
	\item else, if neither of the two score widths and the free score meet the minimum total score width constraint, move onto the next used strip and repeat
	\item if there are no used strips that can accommodate the current box, place the box into a new unused strip, with the smaller score at the beginning of the strip (on the LHS). move onto the next box.
	\item we then obtain ...

\section{FFD Using Exact Algorithm}
\label{sec:ffdexact}
Introduction
\begin{itemize}
	\item This alg will be combining a well known heuristic with an exact algorithm to find a feasible solution to the SCBPP
	\item Becker 2010 recognicity algorithm in polynomial time
	\item doesn't take into account individual widths of boxes
	\item only one strip/align all boxes into one row
	\item in industry, strips have a finite length
	\item algorithm also doesn't output a full solution, only whether there exists a feasible solution or not
	\item ffd but including an algorithm that can find a feasible aligment of boxes with score constraints if one exists
	\item unlike ffd, where boxes are placed onto the end of each strip, the boxes are not fixed in place, all boxes can be reordered.
	\item Can find a solution for a set of boxes on a strip when it may not have been possible to find one in ffdapprox due to only the last box being checked.
	\item try to find a hamiltonian path 
	\item complexity $O(n^2), O(n)$ to construct a solution
	\item if the algorithm cannot find a feasible alignment of the boxes including the current box, move onto next strip and try again.
\end{itemize}

Explanation: Initialise
\begin{itemize}
	\item Let each box be represented by two vertices on a graph $G$, one vertex for each side of the box. Each vertex has a value corresponding to the score width it represent. We will refer to two vertices that represent either side of the same box as ``partners''. The boxes cannot be altered in any way, and so the pairs of vertices must be adjacent to one another on the graph. 
	\item Add extra dominating box with dominating score widths equal to the minimum total score width, the dominating box will be removed at the end.
	\item Therefore we connect pair of vertices that are partners via an edge on the graph $G$.
	\item Call this set of edges $P$.
	\item Edges of P are also weighted, value equivalent to the corresponding box width.
	\item For every pair of vertices on $G$, if the sum of their values/score widths is greater than or equal to the minimum total score width, and the two vertices are not partners/not connected via an edge from $P$, connect the vertices with an edge - call this set of edges $Q$ (These edges are not weighted).
	\item Call a pair of vertices connected via an edge from $Q$ ``matched''.
	\item We want to find an alternating Hamiltonian cycle, where successive edges alternate from sets $P$ and $Q$.
\end{itemize}

MTGMA/MIS
\begin{itemize}
	\item \cite{mahadev1994} Maximum cardinality matching algorithm.
	\item From the set of edges $Q$, we need to obtain a set of edges $M \subset Q$ of cardinality $n$ such that the edges from sets $M$ and $P$ form an alternating Hamiltonian cycle.
	\item We use a simple maximum cardinality matching algorithm to obtain the set of edges $M$ (the matching).
	\item Explain algorithm.
	\item Swap of partners?
	\item Explain matching on a graph.
	\item If $|M| < n$, then infeasible, there is no feasible arrangement of the boxes such that the minimum total score width constraint is met, exit.
	\item If $|M| = n$, then we should have at least one alternating Hamiltonian cycle.
	\item If there is only one cycle, remove the dominating vertices, obtain final solution of boxes in order they should be packed, exit.
	\item Else, if there is more than one cycle, we need to find a way to combine these cycles into one alternating Hamiltonian cycle.
\end{itemize}

FCA/Patch
\begin{itemize}
	\item Find pairs of vertices in each cycle connected via a matching edge/ edge from $M$ that can be broken and rematched.
	\item Break/remove matching edges between vertices and create/add new matching edges such that the cycles are combined/connected.
	\item If there are no vertices that can be rematched from different cycles, then the cycles cannot be joined together, and therefore there is no feasible solution.
	\item Else, if we are able to join the cycles together to create one alternating Hamiltonian cycle, we then simply have to remove the dominating vertices to obtain a final solution/feasible alignment of the boxes.
	\item Sort edges, successive edges, see if edges are from different cycles and if the smaller vertex of the lower indexed edge is adjacent to the larger vertex of the higher indexed edge.
\end{itemize}

DESCRIPTION FFD EXACT
\begin{itemize}
	\item Start with boxes sorted in order of non-increasing widths, breaking ties arbitrarily.
	\item Place the first box onto the first strip, such that the smaller of the two score widths is on the leftmost side of the strip.
	\item Attempt to fit each box $i, i = 2,..., n$ onto the lowest-indexed strip possible that already contains a box, i.e. the strip is not empty.
	\item If a box is able to feasibly fit onto a strip, apply the \textcolor{red}{algorithm} on all of the boxes on the strip plus the current box $i$.
	\item If a feasible alignment of the boxes has been found, replace the current alignment of boxes on the strip with the new alignment, which includes box $i$ (and move onto the next box).
	\item If no feasible alignment of the boxes is found, we move onto the next lowest-indexed strip and repeat.
	\item If a box cannot fit into any of the used strips, i.e. any of the strips that already contain a box/any of the open strips, we then place the box onto a new, unused strip, such that the smaller of the two score widths on the box is on the leftmost side of the strip, then move onto the next box.
	\item Continue untill all boxes have been placed onto a strip/until all boxes have been packed.
\end{itemize}





\section{Comparison and Results}
\label{sec:compresult}

\begin{itemize}
	\item ``Dowsland and Dowsland (1992, ``Packing Problems'') comment that while average or worst-case performance bounds are useful guidelines, it is best to determine an algorithm's usefuless by testing it on data sets typical to the intended problem. Repositories are available on the internet where benchamrk data sets for packing problems are stored for the purpose of evaluating algorithms.''
